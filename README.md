# GitHub Recap 🎧💻

GitHub Recap is a “Spotify Wrapped” style experience for your coding year.

It transforms your GitHub activity into a clean, visual yearly summary — highlighting your most productive months, favorite languages, biggest commits, and overall development trends.

## 🚀 What It Does

GitHub Recap analyzes your public GitHub data and generates:

- 🔥 Longest commit streak  
- 🧠 Top programming languages  
- 📁 Most active repositories

All presented in a clean, recap-style format.
